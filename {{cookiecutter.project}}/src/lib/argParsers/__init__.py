'''Argument parsers will be located gere

Currently, there is just one argument parser. However
you are encouraged to use as many argument parsers
that you wish to have. Ideally you should have one 
argument parser per config file. 

For each config file, you want to add a function for adding
the respective parser to the CLI and another that will 
convert the values back into a dictionary. You have to 
generate a proper namespace for your parsed documents 
so that they can be easily separated. We recommend using
the name of the config file without the extension as a
starting point.
